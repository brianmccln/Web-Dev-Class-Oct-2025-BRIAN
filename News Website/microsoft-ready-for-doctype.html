	<!-- Use <b> here instead Because:
	- not emphasizing the importance of the location 
	- just using visual formatting to style the dateline.
	- screen readers don’t need to emphasize "REDMOND, WA"
	- semantic emphasis (via <strong>) is misleading here.
	- <b> communicates: “Just make this bold, no added meaning.” -->

	<p><strong>REDMOND, WA:</strong> In what CEO Bill Gates called an unfortunate but necessary step to protect our intellectual property from theft and exploitation by competitors, the Microsoft Corporation patented the numbers one and zero Monday.</p>

	<p>With the patent, Microsoft’s rivals are prohibited from manufacturing or selling products containing zeroes and ones unless a royalty fee of 10 cents per digit used is paid to the software giant.</p>

	<p>Some other patents that Microsoft owns:</p>
	<ul>
		<li>Windows</li>
		<li>Microsoft Office</li>
		<li>Xbox</li>
	</ul>
